Out of Office Bot for Slack
===========================

This bot can be told when you are out of the office. It will then listen to conversations and tell users that mention you that you are not around.

If you want a personal OoO bot that acts as you, check out [shaunburdick/slack-ooo-personal](https://github.com/shaunburdick/slack-ooo-personal)!

##Deploying to Heroku
1. `heroku apps:create my-company-ooobot`
2. `git checkout -b production`
3. Copy `./release/js/config.default.js` to `./release/js/config.js` and add the [API token](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot) for your Slack bot user.
4. Open `.gitignore` and remove `config.js`
5. `git add -A`
6. `git commit -a -m 'Added config.js to Heroku production branch'`
7. `git push heroku production:master`

Remember to never merge the production branch with your master since it contains your Slack token :)

##Usage
To use this bot, you start a conversation with it:

```
